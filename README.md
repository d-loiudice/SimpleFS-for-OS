 File System 
   implement a file system interface using binary files
   - The file system reserves the first part of the file
     to store:
     - a linked list of free blocks
     - linked lists of file blocks
     - a single global directory
     
   - Blocks are of two types
     - data blocks
     - directory blocks

     A data block are "random" information
     A directory block contains a sequence of
     structs of type "directory_entry",
     containing the blocks where the files in that folder start
     and if they are directory themselves
